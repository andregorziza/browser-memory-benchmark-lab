## Browser Memory Benchmark Lab

A technical lab that measures real RAM usage per browser tab in modern browsers using
Playwright, Node.js, and direct RSS inspection via /proc on Linux.

This project focuses on defensible, system-level benchmarking at an
SRE / Performance Engineering standard — avoiding the shallow metrics often seen in browser reviews.

🎯 Goals

*Measure the browser’s true memory baseline

*Calculate incremental memory cost per tab

*Compare Chromium-based browsers vs Firefox

*Produce reproducible benchmarks

*Export results to CSV and JSON

🧠 How It Works

*Browsers are launched using Playwright launchServer()

*The real root PID is identified

*Memory usage is calculated by summing the entire process tree

*Metrics are based on OS-level RSS

*The baseline (0 tabs) is automatically subtracted

Results reflect what you actually see in top, htop, and Linux cgroups.

🛠️ Requirements

Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ or compatible)

Node.js 18+

npm

📦 Installation
npm install playwright
npx playwright install --with-deps

📊 Output

results.csv — tab-by-tab memory usage

results.json — structured benchmark data for further analysis

🔬 Intended Audience

*Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)

*Performance Engineers

*Browser and OS researchers

*Anyone interested in real memory behavior, not marketing numbers

⚠️ Notes

Measurements are Linux-specific due to /proc usage

Results may vary by kernel, distro, and browser version

Always run benchmarks on an idle system for best accuracy
